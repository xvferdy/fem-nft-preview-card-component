## My process
> ‚è±Ô∏è My estimate time for this challenge is 2 days
### Built with
- VSCode
- HTML
- Sass

### What I learned
Instead of doing a `margin bottom` on each element I create a `gap` property on the element's parent
###### stylesheets/scss/\_card.scss
```scss
&__content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 16px;
}
```
